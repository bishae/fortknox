### Relationships Between Tables

- **Users** can have one **Role** (

Roles table), but roles can apply to many users.

- Each **Security Event** can lead to one or more **Incidents**, and each incident can have multiple **Incident Responses**.
- **Compliance** scans and reports are conducted by users and are related to different **Compliance Types**.
- **Audit Logs** and **Access Logs** track all user actions and login attempts, respectively.
- **Vulnerabilities** may be linked to multiple **Security Events** when exploited.
- **Notifications** are sent to users based on **Security Events** and **Incidents**.
